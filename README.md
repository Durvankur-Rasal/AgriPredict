AgriPredict
AgriPredict is a web application designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts by providing tools for price prediction, historical price data analysis, and crop prediction based on environmental factors. The app leverages machine learning models in the backend and a modern React-based frontend for a seamless user experience.
Features

Price Prediction: Forecast commodity prices based on market, district, and commodity selection.
Historical Data: View historical price trends for selected commodities in specific markets.
Crop Prediction: Recommend the best crop to grow based on soil and environmental factors like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts: Backend (Python-based) and Frontend (React-based).
Backend
The backend handles data processing, machine learning predictions, and API services.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ (for backend)
Node.js 16+ (for frontend)
npm or yarn (for frontend package management)

Setup Instructions
Backend Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>


Navigate to Backend Directory (if separate):
cd backend


Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Backend Server:
python main.py

The backend API will typically run on http://localhost:5000 (adjust based on your main.py configuration).


Frontend Setup

Navigate to Frontend Directory (if separate):
cd frontend


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Run the Development Server:
npm run dev

The frontend will typically run on http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).


Usage

Access the App:Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173.

Home Page:

The home page provides links to three main features: Price Prediction, Historical Data, and Crop Prediction.


Price Prediction:

Select a commodity, district, and market to predict future prices.
View the predicted minimum, maximum, and modal prices in a formatted card.


Historical Data:

Choose a commodity, district, and market to view historical price trends.
Data is displayed in a table with formatted dates and prices.


Crop Prediction:

Input environmental factors (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).
Receive a recommended crop based on the inputs.



API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints (adjust based on your main.py implementation):

GET /commodities: Fetch available commodities.
GET /districts: Fetch districts for a selected commodity.
GET /markets: Fetch markets for a selected commodity and district.
POST /predict-price: Predict commodity prices.
GET /historical-data: Fetch historical price data.
POST /predict-crop: Predict the best crop based on environmental factors.
